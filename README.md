# hello-world

Very first repository

Hendy here and my hoby/passion is programming. I've recently decided to spend all my time and energy becoming fluent, initially, in C++ with the end goal of making a career change from Civil Engineering to Programming. I know 'Programming' is vague but I honestly don't yet know what type of programming job I'd enjoy most.  I can say for certain that I am thoroughly enjoying learning C++.

I am a self taught programmer.  I loved learning Python in college and have played around with Java and HTML.  I did realize how much I loved it until I started using Visual Basic in Excel.  My current job requires the use of excel for pretty much everything and I loved trying to automate as many processes as possible.  Before you know it, co-workers were asking for my macro enabled workbooks which led me to redesigning them for usability. Long story short, I love programming and am now starting the journey into C++, expect future repositories soon. Wish me luck.
